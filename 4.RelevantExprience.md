My interest in computer science began while in High school, when I first came into contact with computer coding, while creating my own website as a python developer. 
From there on, I was captivated. Without the help from anyone I started building small apps like the calculator, snake game and creating webites, learning how to code and build apps from those Indians on YouTube . 
For me, working on computer code is my way of being creative; every time I write a piece of computer code, I get the feeling I have created something of my own.
In December 2015, I have participated in an coding and programming workshop for a week organized by Andela group and Microsoft in Lagos, where I worked together with the IT team.
This was the first time I ever encountered SQL programming language. The workshop experience was very useful as it enabled me to deepen my understanding of computer science. I gain a lot of coding has on experience.
While in high school, I was a member of Science Club, I have tried to contribute as much as I can with the technical team. In my second year, I was elected to be a technical team leader. My responsibilities were organizing the participants and delegating tasks for the duration of the events. 
I'm a fellow of the 2019 Google Africa Developer Scholarship where I participated in both the Web and Mobile App Development tracks
Today I'm a certified IT Automation with Python Professional
