I have a wife and a four year old daughter. 
My wife is currently studing her degree in Education on a scholarship and hopes to take a teaching job when she finishes her education next month and we also hope to set up a mobile money business for her close to our home.
I'm the only son to my parents and I am tasked with the responsibility of taking care of my aged parents who are retirees 
I currently don't have a any Job and I  committed to educating myself 4 hours daily in order to acquire the relevant skills in Data Science that will enable me secure a job to cater for myself and family.
