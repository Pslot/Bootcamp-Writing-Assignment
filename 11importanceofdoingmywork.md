I can't imagine getting a job through a great opportunity like Umuzi after several years of working hard to secure one and then later get fired due to incompetency.
This is the case when someone manages to scale through an entire syllabus by copying other peoples work. 
Copying other peoples work really silly because it does not make you understand anything and when , an opportunity to prove oneself, you won't be able to pull it off.

It is really important for a coder to take time to understand concepts because developers solve new problems and pioneer solutions to world problems.
When I secure any job, I would be require do use my skills and understanding to solve real world problems doing things nobody has ever done so it will be very important that I understand the concepts of everything because it will form the basis for which I will use to succeed in my problem solving endeavours, scaling huddles and completing every tasks giving to high standard for my employer.
