In order for me to be productive and successful this is how I will structure my day.
I have to plan my activities for the day.
firstly I make a list of everything I will do for the day. The list is my road map for the day.
I will write down the night before or early in the morning all the duties that I have to do that day and also memorize it.
This way I would not miss anything 
The second thing I do is to set my priorities on that list before I start. 
I organise my list with the most important priorities at the top.
I start with the urgent and important matters followed by the important but not urgent matters.
Then followed by the urgent but not important matters.
And the last thing on the list; that is if I have the time to do them will be the not urgent and not important matters
I will focus on these important tasks, always keeping my eyes on the ball.
Thirdly I would concentrate on finishing the tasks.
I will stay on the urgent and important tasks untill they are completed
I will do them or delegate them and when I do delegate them, I will trust and verify them.
I will slice the large tasks into multiple smaller tasks.
I will start one slice at a time. Step by step until the important tasks is completed
Step by step I will start and complete the most important task everyday.
While I'm doing my tasks for the day, I will have to continue to adjust my focus to stay organized and focused without distractions. Always working on the most important things.
Every day I would have to descipline my self concentrate on the task until the task is finished
