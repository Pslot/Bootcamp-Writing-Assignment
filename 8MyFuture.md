My goals are that I want to attain to the peak of the Data Science career path.
The data Science field always presents new challenges and I want to spend the coming years after being sucessful developing deep expertise in the Data Science space.
I'm also focused in the coming years on getting to know my strengths as a Data science professional making use of the mentorship opportunities that Umuzi offers.
I would develop both professionally and personally. I plan to achieve this by completing lots of training development courses, and by working on challenging data science projects that constantly push my skills and qualities.
In the coming years I would want to be seen as a trusted, reliable, and productive member of Umuzi and ACN who can be relied upon to deliver results both on time and to the requested standards
After I build up my credibility and expertise in the few years with Umuzi and ACN, I hope to Mentor others coming into Data Science and bootcamps as mentorship is a big passion of mine.
I want to be seen as someone who could be relied upon to help train up newer bootcampers and members of staff as and when they join Umuzi
In the coming years, I still plan to be working for Umuzi either as data scientist or having gained advancement to a higher level in data science.
I will also have participate in numerous team data science projects and help Umuzi move forward significantly.

I believe success in life means being Happy not how much money you have but on how many smiles you put on the faces of people.
I will be successful in life in order to make a difference in peoples lives and not to make a living.
