If I don't manage to launch a career in data science, This means that I won't be able to make a difference and won't be able to live the life of my dreams.
I won't be able to have responsible friend's, have a family and home filed with love, maintain a good faithful intimate relationship with my spouse, win competitions and advance in life, engage myself in creative activities and get security in life.
I would  struggle to cater for my family, doing jobs that I don't like trying to make ends meet.
I won't be able to eat well, keep fit,achieve a long time balanced work and health life and reduce stress keeping out visits to doctors in my old age.
I wont be able to have and keep a company of like minded data who want to make a difference in their world.
