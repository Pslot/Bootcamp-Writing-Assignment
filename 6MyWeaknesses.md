One of my weakness is that I'm sometimes a little too hard on myself.
 If I get something wrong at work for example, it tends to worry me more than it should do. 
 I think this shows I genuinely care about the organization I am working for.
However, I am concious of this weakness and I have been working to strengthen my mindset so if an issue does occur, I quickly focus on how to put it right and prevent it from happening again in the future.
Secondly, another weakness I have is I don't look at the bigger picture enough because I tend to focus solely on my own work and making sure I do it to a good standard.
I think in any project or job, regardless of the level one is at, it is important to be aware of where the cleint or company is heading and to possess a certain level of commercial awareness.
This is certainly something I plan to develop as time goes on and I will achieve this by paying more attention to wider company developments.
finally, my biggest weakness is I sometimes find it difficult letting go of projects. I tend to get engrossed in them and instead of trying to get the project completed in as fast a time as possible, I keep going back over and checking things.
This is an area I am trying to improve upon by always geting one or two accountability partners who will keep me accountable to the goal of finishing the project on time or as at when due.
